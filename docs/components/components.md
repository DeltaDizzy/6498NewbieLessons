# Basic Robot Components
### **IF YOU DON'T KNOW ALL OF THESE, YOU CANNOT WORK ON THE ROBOT**.

## RoboRIO
The RoboRIO is the brain of the robot. It sends control signals to all parts of the robot and recieves data from sensors. It runs the robot code.

## Power Distribution Panel
The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) takes power from the battery and distributes it to the other components on the robot. Secondary Breakers must be installed on any port that is being used, along with two fuses for the PCM, VRM, and RIO power. (See [Power Distribution Panel](pdp.md) for more details.)
