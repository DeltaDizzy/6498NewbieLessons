<h1>Soldering</h1>

### What is it?
<b>Soldering</b> is the wiring version of <b>welding</b>. It’s where you take a special kind of metal (called <b>solder</b>) and melt it so that it flows onto the wire ends you are trying to join before hardening and joining the wire ends. Electric current likes to flow through metals because metals are normally <b>conductors</b>, and conductors are just materials that currents like to move through. So we need a metal that can attach instantly and easily to bare wire of any size or shape, which is where solder comes in. 

### Solder
Solder is an <b>alloy</b> of several metals along with something called <b>flux</b>. It comes coiled up on spools (appearing to be very malleable metal), and to use it you have to melt it. Once you’ve used it to connect the two, though, your wire will be good to go, and current will jump from one wire to the solder and then from the solder to the other wire. The connections they make are pretty strong too if you do it right.
