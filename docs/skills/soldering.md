<h1>Soldering</h1>

### What is it?
<b>Soldering</b> is the wiring version of <b>welding</b>. Itâ€™s where you take a special kind of metal (called <b>solder</b>) and melt it so that it flows onto the wire ends you are trying to join before hardening and joining the wire ends. Electric current likes to flow through metals because metals are normally <b>conductors</b>, and conductors are just materials that currents like to move through. So we need a metal that can attach instantly and easily to bare wire of any size or shape, which is where solder comes in. Solder is an <b>alloy</b> of several metals along with something called <b>flux</b>. It comes coiled up on spools (appearing to be very malleable metal), and to use it you have to melt it. 

### Soldering
You will need both hands for this, so you need a way to hold your wires still while you solder them. Some soldering kits (like the one we have) come with clamps to hold the wires. Place your wires (or components) in the clamps so that they are touching in-line (they dont meet at an angle) if they are wires. If you are soldering wires to components, the wire should go into the hole at a 90-degree angle. Once your wires are secured, turn on your soldering iron and hold it under the joint so that it is touching both. Wait for 15 seconds or so and then gently press the solder into the top of the joint and hold it there. FINISH ONCE I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.
