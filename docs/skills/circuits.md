### Parts of the Build Process
There’s three parts to making a working robot. The first part, and arguably the biggest aspect, is to actually, you know, build the thing. That’s what the design and fab teams are for. The last part, and arguably the hardest aspect, is to tell the robot what you want it to do. That’s what the programmers are for. However, there’s a middle man in the process. There’s the part where you have to make the robot capable of doing what you want  it to do beyond its physical assembly. To do that, we (and everyone on Earth) use electrical circuitry combined in a gazillion extremely intricate and complicated ways to move an electrical current in order to do things like turn motors and send signals and whatnot. Without electronics, the whole robot However, like everything, it has its basics.

### Basics of electric circuits
The “fundamental unit,” if you will, of electrical circuits is an electrical current. As we all (hopefully) know, electrical currents are streams of electrons. However, in order to have a stream of electrons, or at least one that we can control, we have to move it along the right stuff. Yep, you guessed it: wires. Wiring is only about 2% of the electrical work that goes into the robot, but it is almost the entirety of what we are responsible for, because the rest of the intricacies of our circuitry gets taken care of the manufacturers who make our parts. It is the easiest thing to get wrong, though, and without wires, you don’t have circuits. As such, the first thing to talk about, logically, is how to wire.

### Wiring
There are two significant parts of wiring: knowing where things go, and getting them where they need to go. Most of our electrical parts have specific ports that everything gets attached to. That’s how we know which wires go where and stuff like that. We will revisit this part in more depth later. The other significant part of wiring, getting wires where they need to go, is the point of this exercise. Normally, it’s easy enough. Explaining that to you would be like explaining how to eat. You just plug the wires into where the current comes from and where you want the current to go. Boop, boop, done. However, sometimes, your wires aren’t a very good size at all to reach between your parts. If it’s too big, then you just cut the wire down, but when it’s too short, or maybe you need the wire to branch off into several other wires, well, that’s what soldering is for! :)
